  <div class="copy">
    Designing your app prior to its development guarantees a streamlined and effective process that meets the needs of
    your users and business objectives.
    By planning ahead, you can save valuable time and resources, ultimately resulting in a more successful and
    user-centric product.
    Invest in the design stage of your app to ensure it excels in usability, functionality, and market appeal.
    <div class="benefits">Benefits of designing your app idea before development: </div>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Enhances User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) </b>- Designing your app first allows you to focus on
        creating an seamless user experience.
        Ensuring a consistent design language and user interface (UI) across all screens before development begins.
      </li>
      <li><b>Reduces Development Time and Expenses </b>- Starting to build an app without a design can lead to usability
        problems for developers, who might find themselves making changes that could have been easily prevented during
        the design stage.</li>
      <li><b>Assists in Project Planning and Scope Clarification</b> - With a clear design in place, you can set project
        milestones and deadlines based on specific design and development tasks.
        Having a design to refer to simplifies the process of tracking app development progress and keeps stakeholders
        informed about updates.
      </li>
      <li><b>Enhances Marketing Efforts and Secures Stakeholder Support</b> - A well-crafted design effectively
        communicates the worth and possibilities of your app to investors, stakeholders, and clients. An app design can
        be a powerful tool for securing funding or getting project approval.</li>
    </ul>
    Designing the features of your app idea and gathering insights early in the process, allows you to create a
    clearer path to creating an app that resonates with your target audience.
